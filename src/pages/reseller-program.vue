                    answer: "You do. You can set the pricing for products and services individually, offer special sales and promotions, even provide certain customers with discount pricing. We also have a global pricing option that lets you quickly set the pricing for all of your products at once."

                    question: "What's your commission payment process?",
                    answer: "We offer a wide variety of payout options for your commissions (PayPal, EFT, Check, Covisor Good as Gold). We usually pay the commission you earn during one month at the end of the following month. For example, if you earned commission on your reseller hosting sales during January, we'll pay you at the end of February."

                    id: 5,
                    question: "What does it mean to be a white-label reseller?",
                    answer: "When you sell white-label products or services, the name of the company that produces those services is replaced with your company name. So whether you want to be a white label email reseller or a white label hosting reseller or both, the primary brand name your customers will see is yours. In fact, in most cases, your brand is the only brand your customers will ever see, with a few exceptions. For example, if you sell a domain, you must disclose the accredited domain registrar. In this instance, a customer would see your brand as the seller, but further down in the purchase agreement copy your customer will also see on behalf of WildWestDomains.com as the actual ICANN accredited registrar."

                    id: 6,
                    question: "Can I customize my storefront?",
                    answer: "Yes. You can use our Storefront Branding to make your storefront reflect your personal brand. We give you control over your site's domain name, site logo, color scheme, page layout and more. You can always go back and make changes as your business grows. Or, for those resellers that are familiar with WordPress, we encourage you to make a fully customized site using Covisor's WordPress plugin, which you can learn more about here."

                    question: "What if I need help?",
                    answer: "We're here to help 24/7. Our award-winning support team can help you get up and going, address any technical concerns, even provide tips and tricks on how to become a reseller. It's all included free with your plan."

                    question: "Are there different ways to partner with Covisor?",
                    answer: "If you'd like to earn generous commissions through referral sales from your website visitors and email recipients, check out our Affiliate Program. Or, if you are looking for a way to manage all of your customers websites and clients, with one dashboard and a family of integrated tools, check out our Covisor Pro Program."

                    id: 10,
                    question: "What is the difference between Covisor Pro and Reseller?",
                    answer: "Covisor's Reseller program allows you to set your own prices and sell Covisor products under your own brand, whereas Covisor Pro provides developers and designers with free tools to manage their clients and sites."

                {
                    id: 8,
                    question: "Who takes payment from my customer?",
                    answer: "Although your customers will buy from your white labeled store front, when they enter the transaction experience they will be directed to a still white-labeled cart experience, but that contract, experience and payment collection are managed by WildWestDomains.com, a Covisor entity, in the background. You, as the reseller, then get paid the net commissions from each transacted amount."
